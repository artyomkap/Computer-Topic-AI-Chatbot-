What is RAM?;"RAM is a high-speed, short-term storage solution that gives applications, games, and the operating system itself, quick access to important information. That saves it the time of retrieving the data from much slower storage, like hard drives and SSDs."
What is CPU?;The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results.
What is Graphic Card?;A graphics card (GPU) is an expansion card for your PC that is responsible for rendering images to the display.

What parts does computer consist of?;To operate, a computer must consist of a motherboard, processor, RAM, video card (discrete or integrated into the processor), storage and power supply.
Discrete and Integrated Graphic Card?;Discrete and integrated graphics are two types of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in computers. Integrated graphics are built into the CPU and share memory and processing power with it, while discrete graphics are separate cards with their own memory, processor, and cooling system.
What is SSD?;An SSD, or solid-state drive, is a type of storage device used in computers. This non-volatile storage media stores persistent data on solid-state flash.
What are peripheral devices?;A Peripheral Device is defined as a device that provides input/output functions for a computer and serves as an auxiliary computer device without computing-intensive functionality.
What is keyboard?; Keyboard is an Input device, which allow user to input information using letters and digits.
